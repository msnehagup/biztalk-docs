# BizTalk Server 2020: What's New, and Installation

## Get started with BizTalk Server 2020

This release builds on the world's leading integration broker with full support of new features introduced in the BizTalk 2016 Feature Packs along with updated platform support and new capabilities.  Support for the latest Microsoft platform makes this the safest ever BizTalk server release that enables hybrid integration seamlessly. The Feature Pack concept introduced in 2016 makes this the most stable off the shelf release of BizTalk Server ever released. Several capabilities introduced as part of this release have already been implemented successfully in production environment at our enterprise customers. 

Traditionally, integration has been either on-premises system to system EAI (Enterprise Application Integration) or business to business (B2B), today, many companies wish to integrate with systems which are well beyond the corporate firewall, often SaaS-based, API-centric providers handling everything from sales leads to invoicing, email and social media. Microsoft BizTalk Server 2020 allows customers to integrate disparate applications and heterogeneous data to deliver a variety of solutions such as payment processing, supply chain management, business-to-business EDI, real-time decision making, and reporting. This release allows customers to achieve true hybrid connectivity by connecting on-premises systems to SaaS applications through Azure connectivity.

Starting with this release, BizTalk server aims to embark upon a more open and collaborative evolution in times to come.
